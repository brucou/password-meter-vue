# Password meter demo application
This is a demo for a simplified password meter which evaluates the strength of a password. A 
password will be considered strong if and only if it includes both letters and numbers.

The application showcases integration of the state machine library [`state-transducer`](https://github.com/brucou/state-transducer) with Vue.js.

# Installation
`npm install`

# Running the demo
`npm run serve`
